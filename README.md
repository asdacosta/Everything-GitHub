## Terminologies

The following are some concepts in GitHub

| Terms | Discription |
| ----- | ----------- |
| `GitHub` | Is a collaboration platform which provides web-based graphical interface that helps manage `Git` repositories or that uses Git for versioning (creating different versions of software or code, with each representing a set of changes or updates). |
| `Git` | Is an `open-source version control system` that is used to manage and keep track of changes to `source codes`. |
| `Repository` | Is a project or storage location containing files and folders. |
| `Open-source` | Refers to a software or project for which the `source code` is designed to be publicly accessible for free, granting the users to use, modify, and distribute the code. |
| `Source code` | is a set of written instructions that make up a computer program, written in programming language. It can be used interchangeably with `code`. |
| `Version Control System` | Also known as `revision control system` or `source control system` or `source code management system` is a software used to track and manage changes made to source codes. Examples include Git, Mercurial, and Subversion. |
| `README` | Is a file in a repository that provides info about the project. |
| `Branch` | Is a copy of a `codebase` that allows developers to work on different versions of or features of that codebase. When a new branch is created, it is a clone of the original codebase (main/master). Developers can now make changes to the code on the newly created branch without affecting the original code of the main/master branch. Branches can be merged into the original branch after changes has been tested and approved.  This allows developers to work on different features or versions of the codebase simultaneously, while keeping the main branch stable and updated with approved changes. |
| `Codebase` | Is simply the collection of source code files and resources that make up a software project. |
